# Scratch-Ultimate-Coding-Shop2

- Hello! Welcome to the repository for the making of the website for the Scratch Ultimate Coding Shop! 
- If you want to contribute, feel free to - just make a pull request and we will review the changes. 
- I'm not particularly amazing at web development (as in Nambaseking01) so I'd like some help from workers and external users.
- Feel free to clone git and use repl.it for changes and help out that way too.
- This is currently in development so many things might not be correct.

- What will this website contain?
- Probably some information about SUCS, any external services, or something related to web development. 
- We will also probably add in some sections from the actual shop. 
- As we continue to improve, maybe special events to win prices? *Exciting!*
